*January 2025 ‚Äì April 2025*  
 Guided by society leads | üåç Focused on sustainability and circularity

##  Overview
This project aimed to analyze and optimize industrial waste streams across multiple sectors using simulation tools, life-cycle assessment frameworks, and valorization techniques. Special focus was given to process inefficiencies, environmental impact, and the economic viability of waste management strategies.

---

##  Objectives
- Develop a comprehensive waste management framework using **process simulation**, **mass-energy balances**, and **impact assessment**.
- Evaluate sector-specific waste streams such as **discarded fish nets** (marine plastic) and **agro-waste from rice mills**.
- Enable circular economy interventions by identifying **valorization** and **process redesign** opportunities.

##  Methodology

###  Marine Waste: Fish Nets in Odisha
- Conducted field-level waste stream analysis for **discarded fish nets** in coastal Odisha.
- Assessed the feasibility of valorization using mechanical and thermochemical pathways.

###  Agro-Industrial: Rice Mills
- Performed end-to-end analysis of **rice milling processes**, from input sourcing to product distribution.
- Evaluated operational inefficiencies, waste outputs, and profitability.
- Explored valorization options for rice husk and wastewater.

###  Process Simulation
- Simulated process flows using **ASPEN Plus**, performing **mass‚Äìenergy balances**.
- Optimized waste handling through **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** and **Product Carbon Footprint (PCF)** tools.
- Evaluated **fluidized bed pyrolysis** for plastic waste valorization with high efficiency and minimal landfill impact.

---

##  Key Results
- Identified impactful **process redesigns** and **waste valorization strategies** for marine and agro-industrial sectors.
- Proposed circularity models that reduce emissions, sludge, and operational costs.
- Demonstrated potential for scale-up and integration into real-world industrial setups.
